                    Hey! Hey! Hey!

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickyneuberger/" target="_blank">I'll walk with you</a>, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes

And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey! Hey! Hey!

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love

Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey! Hey!

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
<a href="mailto:nicollyneuberger@gmail.com">Just let me go</a>, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
